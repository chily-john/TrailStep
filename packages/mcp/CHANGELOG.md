# @trailstep/mcp

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- 30edf9e: Per-workflow MCP tools with automatic generation and registration. Adding a workflow now generates `.trailstep/mcp/trst_<id>.json` (description plus input params from `defineWorkflow` input shape), refreshed on `trailstep update --workflows`; the MCP server publishes each workflow as its own tool by default, with `mcp.perWorkflowTools: false` falling back to a `trst_list` catalog alongside the generic `trst_run_workflow` / `trst_watch` / `trst_answer` / `trst_resume` toolkit. `trailstep init` and `trailstep add` auto-offer `add-mcp` registration of the `trailstep mcp` server (absolute `--project`, headless-safe manual fallback). The legacy `skill` field in `defineWorkflow` remains accepted for backwards compatibility.
- 4dba420: Robust MCP server as thin adapters over existing run/watch/answer/continue seams. The MCP package now runs a real Model Context Protocol server (low-level Server plus StdioServerTransport): `trst_run_workflow` returns real run ids immediately while the run continues detached in the background, `trst_watch` streams `events.jsonl` offsets with long-poll, `trst_answer` writes real wait files with branch disambiguation, and `trst_resume` continues runs; `trailstep://project` and `trailstep://instructions` resources included. `trailstep mcp --project <dir>` is the foreground server (no detached spawn, no stubs). Core `load-order` uses `os.homedir` with explicit project dir and local-over-project-over-global precedence, and the manifest working-provider timeout guard no longer throws when no timeout is set.
