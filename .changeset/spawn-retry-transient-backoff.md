Retry transient working-agent spawn failures with exponential backoff instead of burning the agent target chain. Windows process-level deaths (e.g. `0xC0000142` `STATUS_DLL_INIT_FAILED`) and resource-exhausted spawn errors are now classified as transient: the format phase is retried in the same session (never re-running Phase 1 work) and failing targets are retried before falling back, with growing jittered delays (default 4 attempts, 2s base, x3, 60s cap) configurable via `settings.spawnRetry`. Failures are now visible the moment they happen: new `agent.attemptFailed` events, an incremental `attempts.json` audit trail per step, and captured spawn `stderr.txt` artifacts. Track state records `ownerPid` so runs left `running` by a dead runner are reported as orphaned instead of silently active.
