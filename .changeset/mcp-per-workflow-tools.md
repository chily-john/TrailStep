Per-workflow MCP tools with automatic generation and registration. Adding a workflow now generates `.trailstep/mcp/trst_<id>.json` (description plus input params from `defineWorkflow` input shape), refreshed on `trailstep update --workflows`; the MCP server publishes each workflow as its own tool by default, with `mcp.perWorkflowTools: false` falling back to a `trst_list` catalog alongside the generic `trst_run_workflow` / `trst_watch` / `trst_answer` / `trst_resume` toolkit. `trailstep init` and `trailstep add` auto-offer `add-mcp` registration of the `trailstep mcp` server (absolute `--project`, headless-safe manual fallback). The legacy `skill` field in `defineWorkflow` remains accepted for backwards compatibility.
